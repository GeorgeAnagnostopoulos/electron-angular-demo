It all started with the fabulus Electron documentation.
Electron is a runtime for creating applications in Javascript originally meant to run in web servers.
In this sense you can view it as a Node.js variant. Also, Electron app's main process can access
Node.js APIs for whatever reason you may need to.

Off to the code now. I started with the electron-quick-start. To get and run this quickstart you need to
have git and node.js installed in your machine. Assuming that all the prerequisites are met you use
the command:

npm install electron-prebuilt --global 

to install the Electron runtime and be able to use the "electron" command below. Then use the command:

git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start.git electron-test

to get a copy of electron-quick-start in a directory named electron-test in your hard disk.
Then type

cd electron-test

and

npm install && npm start

to observe a running Electron application.

The web page displayed is in the file index.html where the corresponding Javascript file
named renderer.js is also used. I removed it and named mine index.js residing in the js directory I created.
Also, the Chromium Devtools tab is displayed. Super helpful!

Enter angular and Bootstrap!

I typed:

npm install bower --save-dev

to install Bower and 

bower init to initialize it. I will use Bower to install Bootstrap.

Then I used npm to install Angular and Bower to install Bootstrap

npm install angular@1.5.6 --save

bower install bootstrap --save

Everything now is set. I created an angular module named "electronApp" and a controller named "mainCtrl":

'use strict';

angular.module('electronApp', [])
.controller('mainCtrl', ['$scope', '$http', ($scope, $http) => {

    $scope.msg = 'JSONPlaceHolder User List';
    $scope.users = [];

    const   base_url = 'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com';
    $http.get(base_url + '/users').success((data) => {        
        $scope.users = data;
    })
    .error((error) => {
        console.log(error);
    });
}]);

I used the JSONPlaceHolder to get some data and display it in my web page. I changed the index.html file 
a bit to incorporate Bootstrap and Angular boilerplate code and voila! The Users object form JSONPlaceHolder!

I the well-presented Electron documentation you can find information on how to package the application for various OSes.
Check it out in http://electron.atom.io/docs/.

This process was very straightforward and I'm looking forward to include some tests and use it in production.

The resulting demo project is here.
